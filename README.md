# Keylogger using `pynput`

This is a simple **keylogger** script written in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes and logs them into a file.

## ⚠ Disclaimer  
This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can violate privacy laws. Use it only on systems you own or have explicit permission to monitor.

## Features
- Captures and logs keypresses.
- Saves keystrokes to a `keyfile.txt`.
- Prints pressed keys in the console.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. You also need the `pynput` library.

Install it using:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surrey-78/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

3. **Stop the script:**  
   Press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal.

## 📂 Output
- The pressed keys will be printed in the terminal.
- Logged keys will be stored in `keyfile.txt`.

## 📝 Notes
- Special keys like **Shift, Enter, Backspace** are not logged directly. You can modify the script to handle them.
